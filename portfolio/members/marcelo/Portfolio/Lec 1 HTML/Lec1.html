        <h2>Evolution of Web Design</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>The first ever website</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first ever website was created by a
                    scientist named Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1990
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was basically a text-based website with a few links.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A copy of the original page from 1992 still exists online. It simply existed to serve and tell people what the <b> World Wide Web (WWW) </b> was:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most websites to follow were pretty much the same. There were entirely text-based with simple HTML markup:
                </li>
                <li><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> for titles</li>
                <li><b>&lt;p&gt;</b> for paragraphs</li>
                <li><b>&lt;a&gt;</b> for links</li>
            </ul>
            <li>1994 and the WWW Consortium</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It was mainly to discourage and prevent private companies from building their own web language, as it would create chaos on the web.</li>
                <li>The W3C to this day continues to deliver standards for the open web, such as the new HTML5 or CSS3.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Table-based layouts</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Web design became more interesting with the introduction of table markups in HTML.</li>
                <li>
                    The usage of spacer GIFs, introduced in David's Siegel's book <b> Creating Killer Sites </b> in 1996, allowed web designers
                    to play with white space (basically, small transparent GIFs were placed in between the content), and by
                    incorporating a sliced image background, users would have an illusion of a simple structure, whereas in reality
                    there was a table layout behind it.
                </li>
                <li>Websites have visit counters, animated gifs, and so on.</li>
                <li>Text and images were literally dancing across websites everywhere.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Introduction of Flash</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Flash, previously Macromedia Flash and currently Adobe Flash, was created in 1996.</li>
                <li>Back then it was the killer tool to create interactive and graphics websites.</li>
                <li>
                    However, it was not <b> Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b>-friendly and was very heavy in terms of resources for
                    your computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flash started to decline when Apple decided to stop supporting Flash in their iOS software back in 2010 (https:/ /
                    www. apple. com/ hotnews/ thoughts- on- flash/).
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the new features of HTML5/CSS3, where you are able to create animation and add multimedia content,
                    designers and developers soon diverted from Flash, at least for web design.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>CSS - the savior</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CSS defines how the HTML is displayed, and this
                    has allowed designers to separate the content
                    and the design, making websites easier to
                    maintain and quicker to load.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You could change the entire look of a CSS-based
                    website without touching the content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS really made the difference as an alternative
                    to Flash. Recommended by the W3C as a best
                    practice, it provides a cleaner semantic, resulting
                    in better SEO
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>CSS DOWNSIDE</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>
                However, one downside of CSS was the lack of
                support from various browsers
            </li>
            <li>
                One browser would support the newest feature,
                while another would not. It was a nightmare for
                developers.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Web 2.0. THE RISE OF JAVASCRIPT</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>The rise of mobile</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The iPhone ultimately started the boom of mobile
                    browsing. Nobody in the web industry saw this coming;
                </li>
                <li>It was clearly not user-friendly at all.</li>
                <li>Until 2016, for the first time in the world, mobile and tablet internet usage exceeded desktop usage:</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Responive Design</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ethan Marcotte in 2011</li>
                <li>
                    He described a new way of designing for the desktop but also for the mobile interface, basically proposing to use
                    the same content, but a different layout for the design on each screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The most popular versions being used were either 12 or 16 columns. It became a standard for designers to
                    design their websites using 12 columns for desktop and downgrading progressively for mobile viewing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the introduction of media queries with CSS3, it became easier for designers to design websites for mobile
                    screens.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Flat Design</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Flat design is the term given to the style of design in which elements DO NOT HAVE stylistic shapes and
                    characters, such as gradient, drop shadows, textures, and any type of
                    design that makes it look real and three dimensional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's usually described as the opposite of rich design, which in contrast
                    is used to make elements feel more tactile, real, and usable for users
                    when they're navigating.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Swiss Style Trend</li>
            <ul>
                <li>People often say that flat design originated from the Swiss Style, Swiss
                    Style (also known as International Typographic Style) was the
                    dominant design style back in the 1940-50s and started in Switzerland.
                </li>
                <li>It became a solid foundation for graphic design in the mid-20th century
                    around the world.
                </li>
                <li>The main characteristics of this design style are the use of asymmetric
                    layouts, grids, sans-serif typefaces such as Akzidenz Grotesk, and a
                    clean hierarchy of content.
                </li>
                <li>The famous typeface Helvetica was created during this period and was
                    used in every type of design.
                </li>
                <li>The main reason for this trend was mainly caused by the development of responsive design during this period,
                    where developers and designers struggled to implement a design that heavily relied on textures, drop-shadows,
                    and background images.
                </li>
                <li>Shrinking those patterns for various screen sizes and because of browser compatibility constraints was just too
                    much for designers. They had to go back to basics and simplify their design and make it less texturized.
                </li>
                <li>This would result in quicker loading websites and would be more efficient and easier to design.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>What's next?</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Web design is a mix of visual design (influenced by print design) and the technology used on the web.</li>
                <li>
                    With the advancements made in HTML5 and CSS3, we can start to see that design is becoming far more complex
                    as compared to the original flat design.
                </li>
                <li>Technology now allows people to have more flexibility with their design and forms</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
