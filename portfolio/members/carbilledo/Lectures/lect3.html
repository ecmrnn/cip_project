  <h1>How to cook Adobo</h1>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p> Begin by frying the chicken pieces over high heat with a small amount of oil until they are brown. This process is called searing, and this adds flavour and color to the meat. Make sure that the meat pieces are not wet or you will not achieve the desired color you are looking for. Also, do not overcrowd the pot because the juices from the meat will run out and thus prevent the browning effect of the meat. </p></li>
      <li><p> The next step would be to drop all the ingredients in the same pot and bring the liquid to a boil. Bring down the heat to a simmer and slowly cook the chicken. Pour more water for a saucy adobo and cook further if you want a drier adobo. </p></li>
      <li><p> With or without sauce, adobo will always be a comforting dish served any time of day especially when shared with the family. <br><br><br></p></li>
